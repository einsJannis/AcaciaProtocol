# Acacia Protocol **!!!WIP!!!**

This is a Kotlin multiplatform library with which you can easily interface with the networking protocol of the
Minecraft Java edition.

# Why Acacia Protocol

This allows you to easily implement a Minecraft server/client without creating hundrets of packet classes and worrying 
about networking at all.

## Used libraries:

 - ktor-network
 - kotlinx-coroutines
 - kotlinx-serialization
 - krypto

## Supported Minecraft Versions

We are still in development, and we've only managed to kinda support 1.15.2 so far.

## Getting started

### Maven/Gradle

We are still in development, and this project can't be found on a maven repository yet and you'll have to compile it
yourself if you want to try it out.

### Setting up a server

We have an example limbo server for testing [here](src/jvmTest/kotlin/limboserver/Test.kt).

### Setting up a client

Coming Soon TM
